    "title": "Collateral",
    "intro": "Cryptocurrency lending has become a popular way for you to access liquidity without selling your digital assets. By using your WLD as collateral, you can secure loans in traditional currencies such as USD. Here's a breakdown of how this process works:",
    "collateralization": {
      "title": "Collateralization",
      "description": "When you opt for a crypto-backed loan, you pledge a certain amount of your cryptocurrency as collateral. The amount you can borrow is typically determined by the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio set by the lending platform. For instance, with an LTV of 50%, if you provide $10,000 worth of WLD, you can borrow $5,000 in USD. It's important to note that due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, these loans are often over-collateralized to mitigate risk."
    },
    "interestRates": {
      "title": "Interest Rates and Loan Terms",
      "description": "Interest rates for crypto-backed loans can vary based on the platform and prevailing market conditions. Some platforms offer rates as low as 0%, while others may charge higher rates depending on the LTV and the specific cryptocurrency used as collateral. Loan terms are generally flexible, allowing borrowers to choose durations that suit their financial needs."
    },
    "marginCalls": {
      "title": "Margin Calls and Liquidation Risks",
      "description": "One crucial aspect to be aware of is the risk of margin calls. If the value of your collateral decreases significantly due to market fluctuations, the platform may require you to add more collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. Failure to do so could result in the liquidation of your assets to cover the loan. Therefore, it's essential to monitor the value of your collateral and be prepared to act if necessary."
    },
    "platformSelection": {
      "title": "Platform Selection and Supported Assets",
      "description": "Not all lending platforms accept every cryptocurrency as collateral. While major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are widely accepted, others, such as WorldCoin, may not be supported. It's crucial to research and choose a reputable platform that aligns with your specific needs and accepts your preferred cryptocurrency."
    },
    "taxImplications": {
      "title": "Tax Implications",
      "description": "Using cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan is generally not considered a taxable event since you're not selling the asset. However, if your collateral is liquidated to cover a margin call, it could trigger capital gains or losses. It's advisable to consult with a tax professional to understand the potential implications fully."
    },
    "summary": "In summary, crypto-backed loans offer a way to access funds without parting with your digital assets. However, it's essential to understand the terms, risks, and platform specifics before proceeding. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting financial advisors to ensure this approach aligns with your financial goals."
